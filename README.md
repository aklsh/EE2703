# Applied Programming Lab

Dump of all codes and reports done as part of EE2703: Applied Programming Lab (Jan-May 2020).

## Organisation of the Repo

Each week is in separate folders. All material pertaining to that week is in that folder. The question for week `x` is in `Assignment x - Question.pdf`. The code submitted on Moodle is in `code.py`. "Additional Homeworks" (if any) are as separate `.py` files with the name as the _section number_ in the question pdf.
